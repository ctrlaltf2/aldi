# Aldi Price Scraper
Simple Aldi price scraper to allow for open and democratic analysis of everyday grocery price trends over time.

# Usage
This is a self-contained [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) script, so have uv installed then simply run the script from the shell.

# Roadmap
 - [ ] Automated publishing of historical data for a store representative of median US COL
 - [ ] Price diffs
 - [ ] Unit prices (requires mini parser)

# Remarks
This scrapes the product pickup API, and products are around 10-15% more than the in-person prices. Most of the time, the markup is about 10% but not exactly 10%, and there's some cases of 15% markup for cheaper items. Currently there's no obvious pattern but it's a work in progress for finding a way back to the true prices.
